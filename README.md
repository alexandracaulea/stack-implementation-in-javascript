# Stack implementation in JavaScript

- First, I start with implementing the class `Stack` which is used for the stack.
- In order to store the data in the stack, I am using the constructor method to create and initialize the stack. The `data` variable will hold elements to our stack.
- The `push` method is used to add elements to our stack.
- The `pop` method is used to remove the last element from our stack.
- The `peek` method is used to return the last element in the data property (our array).
- The `empty` method is used to check if there are any values in the stack.
